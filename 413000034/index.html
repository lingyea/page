  [Verse 1]<br>
  See, right now, I need you, I'll meet you somewhere now<br>
  You up now, I see you, I get you, take care now<br>
  Slow down, be cool, I miss you, come here now<br>
  It's yours now, keep it, I'll hold out until now<br>
  I need you right now, once I leave you I'm strung out<br>
  If I get you, I'm slowly breaking down<br>
  <br>
  [Chorus]<br>
  And, oh, it's hard to see you, but I wish you were right here<br>
  Oh, it's hard to leave you when I get you everywhere<br>
  All this time I'm thinking we could never be a pair<br>
  Oh, no, I don't need you, but I miss you, come here<br>
  And, oh, it's hard to see you, but I wish you were right here<br>
  Oh, it's hard to leave you when I get you everywhere<br>
  All this time I'm thinking, I'm strong enough to sink it<br>
  Oh, no, I don't need you, but I miss you, come here<br>
  <br>
  [Post-Chorus]<br>
  He love me not, he loves me<br>
  He holds me tight, then lets me go<br>
  He love me not, he loves me<br>
  He holds me tight, then lets me go<br>
  <br>
  [Verse 2]<br>
  Soon as you leave me, we always lose connection<br>
  It's gettin' messy, I fiend for your affection<br>
  Don't loosen your grip got a hold on me<br>
  Now, forever, let's get back together<br>
  <br>
  [Pre-Chorus]<br>
  Lord, take it so far away<br>
  I pray that, God, we don't break<br>
  I want you to take me up and down<br>
  And round and round again<br>
  <br>
  [Chorus]<br>
  And, oh, it's hard to see you, but I wish you were right here<br>
  Oh, it's hard to leave you when I get you everywhere<br>
  All this time I'm thinking we could never be a pair<br>
  Oh, no, I don't need you, but I miss you, come here<br>
  And, oh, it's hard to see you, but I wish you were right here<br>
  Oh, it's hard to leave you when I get you everywhere<br>
  All this time I'm thinking, I'm strong enough to sink it<br>
  Oh, no, I don't need you, but I miss you, come here<br>
  <br>
  [Post-Chorus]<br>
  He love me not, he loves me<br>
  He holds me tight, then lets me go<br>
  He love me not, he loves me<br>
  He holds me tight, then lets me go<br>
  He love me not, he loves me<br>
  He holds me tight, then lets me go<br>
  He love me not, he loves me<br>
  He holds me tight, then lets me go<br>
  <br>
  [Bridge]<br>
  You're gonna say that you're sorry at the end of the night<br>
  Wake up in the morning, everything's alright<br>
  At the end of the story, you're holdin' me tight<br>
  I don't need to worry, am I out of my mind?<br>
  <br>
  [Chorus]<br>
  And, oh, it's hard to see you, but I wish you were right here (I'm losing my mind)<br>
  Oh, it's hard to leave you when I get you everywhere<br>
  All this time I'm thinking, I'm strong enough to sink it<br>
  Oh, no, I don't need you, but I miss you, come here<br>
