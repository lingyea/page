[Verse 1]<br>
See, right now, I need you, I'll meet you somewhere now<br>
You up now, I see you, I get you, take care now<br>
Slow down, be cool, I miss you, come here now<br>
It's yours now, keep it, I'll hold out until now<br>
I need you right now, once I leave you I'm strung out<br>
If I get you, I'm slowly breaking down<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
And, oh, it's hard to see you, but I wish you were right here<br>
Oh, it's hard to leave you when I get you everywhere<br>
All this time I'm thinking we could never be a pair<br>
Oh, no, I don't need you, but I miss you, come here<br>
And, oh, it's hard to see you, but I wish you were right here<br>
Oh, it's hard to leave you when I get you everywhere<br>
All this time I'm thinking, I'm strong enough to sink it<br>
Oh, no, I don't need you, but I miss you, come here<br>
<br>
[Post-Chorus]<br>
He love me not, he loves me<br>
He holds me tight, then lets me go<br>
He love me not, he loves me<br>
He holds me tight, then lets me go<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
Soon as you leave me, we always lose connection<br>
It's gettin' messy, I fiend for your affection<br>
Don't loosen your grip got a hold on me<br>
Now, forever, let's get back together<br>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus]<br>
Lord, take it so far away<br>
I pray that, God, we don't break<br>
I want you to take me up and down<br>
And round and round again<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
And, oh, it's hard to see you, but I wish you were right here<br>
Oh, it's hard to leave you when I get you everywhere<br>
All this time I'm thinking we could never be a pair<br>
Oh, no, I don't need you, but I miss you, come here<br>
And, oh, it's hard to see you, but I wish you were right here<br>
Oh, it's hard to leave you when I get you everywhere<br>
All this time I'm thinking, I'm strong enough to sink it<br>
Oh, no, I don't need you, but I miss you, come here<br>
<br>
[Post-Chorus]<br>
He love me not, he loves me<br>
He holds me tight, then lets me go<br>
He love me not, he loves me<br>
He holds me tight, then lets me go<br>
He love me not, he loves me<br>
He holds me tight, then lets me go<br>
He love me not, he loves me<br>
He holds me tight, then lets me go<br>
<br>
[Bridge]<br>
You're gonna say that you're sorry at the end of the night<br>
Wake up in the morning, everything's alright<br>
At the end of the story, you're holdin' me tight<br>
I don't need to worry, am I out of my mind?<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
And, oh, it's hard to see you, but I wish you were right here (I'm losing my mind)<br>
Oh, it's hard to leave you when I get you everywhere<br>
All this time I'm thinking, I'm strong enough to sink it<br>
Oh, no, I don't need you, but I miss you, come here<br>
